## System Description
Nethack is an old game where you walk in a dungeon and explore. Each level has a different landscape which is generated randomly. The objective of the system we are going to develop is to make a similar game where the map is generated by Twitter feeds. The system shall also follow a list of requirements.

## High Level Epics
**Motivation for priority:** Big tasks, important to the customer, can be broken down

* #14 As a game designer I want the game to have caves with labyrinths where the maps are generated by the use of Twitter API so that I do not have to program all maps and the number of maps will be increased.
* #15 As a player I would like to be able to chat with other players in a chatroom and be able to give/use items on the other players so that the game becomes more social
* #16 As a game designer I want the players to have health and the functionality of dieing so that the games do not get to easy
* #17 As a player I should be able to pick up items to my backpack and use them or drop them so that the game gets more exciting
* #18 As a player I want there to be other characters that move around freely in the game which I can interact with so that the game gets more fun
